# Book Application #
The Book App is a web application that displays a library of books to the user. The user can see a list of their favorite books, as well as information about them such as the author, summary, price, and publisher, to name a few. In addition, the user can add their own book to the app and see it listed with all of the other books. In addition, the user can update their own book by adding or removing whatever elements they see suitable. In addition, if someone does not want to read the book, they can erase it. The user can also look for a book by its title, such as Harry Potter.
